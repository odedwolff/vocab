-implement create category 

-extend add expression:
	enable adding category
	enable add expression with it translation (is it actually the only way to create the connection to the translation? )
	
	
	
-add empty item to top of lists, to make clear that no itam is selected upon updating of list options 
update: this is not just awkward, it also creates a bug, because the current language 
selection is only set at change, so if the first item in the list is selected, 
it doesnt make a change, and the current selection is not bening updated
